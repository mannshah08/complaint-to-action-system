# Complaint to Action System – Community Pulse

An AI-assisted complaint management platform built for an Open Innovation hackathon.

## Problem
Traditional complaint systems act as black boxes — users submit issues but never see visibility, progress, or impact.

## Solution
This project transforms complaints into a transparent, community-driven system:
- AI classifies complaints by category and urgency
- Admin dashboard for action and filtering
- Public “Community Pulse” board for non-sensitive issues
- Users can upvote existing issues instead of duplicating complaints

## Key Features
- Complaint submission portal
- AI-based urgency & category classification
- Admin dashboard with priority filters
- Public issues board with upvoting
- Role-based access (student / admin)

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- SQLite
- Rule-based AI logic (extensible to ML models)

## How to Run
```bash
python app.py
